    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong's gameplay is similar to its predecessor Hollow Knight, featuring 2D platforming and combat. 
Some changes are made from the original, such as Hornet moving with a more acrobatic flair compared to Hollow Knight's protagonist, and that healing is faster.
Side-quests are part of the game, and include a journal to keep track of them.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was originally planned as downloadable content for Hollow Knight. This piece of downloadable content, set to have the player control Hornet, was in development even before the release of Hollow Knight.<br/> 
Eventually, due to <i>the increased size and scope of the project</i>, Team Cherry decided to expand it into a fully-fledged sequel titled Hollow Knight: Silksong.
